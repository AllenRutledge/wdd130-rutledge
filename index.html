        <p>Hello World! My name is Allen Rutledge! I'm a Computer Science major at BYUI. My career goal is getting a job in the field of software development, cybersecurity, business information management, or AI development.</p>
        <p>My interests are computers, video games, cats, masks, AI, and virtual reality. I love modding video games, tinkering with tech, and making art.</p>
        <p>I'm not that good at navigating web pages, let alone making them. However, I wish to improve, I wish to become well-versed in it and be the best I can be. This class will help further my progress in my computer science degree, and will help me understand websites and programming even further.</p>
